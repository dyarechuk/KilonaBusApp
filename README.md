# BusApp

This project is designed to allow users to browse available bus routes, select specific available seats on a bus, and obtain information about the departure point's location on a map. Additionally, users can view detailed seat availability, make reservations, and access real-time updates on their chosen routes.

## Technologies

The following technologies are used in this project:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev//): A framework that allows developers to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React, with the ability to create natively rendered user interfaces from a single codebase.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A refined version of JavaScript that integrates type annotations into the language.
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/): A lightweight, fast, and scalable state management library for React and React Native applications, allowing for global state management with a minimal API.
- [React Native Maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-maps/): A library that provides customizable map components for React Native applications, allowing developers to integrate maps from providers like Google Maps and Apple Maps into their mobile apps.
- [React Native Geocoding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-geocoding/): A library that allows developers to convert addresses into geographic coordinates (geocoding) and vice versa (reverse geocoding) within React Native applications using the Google Maps Geocoding API.

    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. When bundler is ready, press A key to run Android application, or you can press I button to run application on iOS.

3. Additionally, you will need to install Android Studio and set up an emulator to run the application. It is also recommended to configure the environment for iOS if you plan to test on both platforms, ensuring compatibility and smooth performance across devices.
